  # E-commerce Exercise
  

  
  ## Description: 

  This project was an exercise in creating the back-end functionality of an e-commerce application using mysql, Sequelize, and an assortment of other npm packages. API routes were established to execute RESTful CRUD methods on category, product, and tag models that are often found on a standard e-commerce application. Insomnia was used to test the endpoints due to the lack of a front-end UI.

  ## Installation: 
 
  This app is not deployed in the standard sense, but the user could clone the repository and test the various API routes via Insomnia.
  

  
  ## Usage: 

  The user can use CRUD methods to manipulate the categories, products, and tags of various items within an e-commerce application. There is no front-end UI, so the user must use Insomnia or something similar to test the API endpoints and the efficacy of the various PUT, POST, GET, and DELETE methods.
