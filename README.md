  ## Installation: 
 
  This app is not deployed, but the user could clone the repository and test the various API routes via Insomnia.
  

  
  ## Usage: 

  The user can use CRUD methods to manipulate the categories, products, and tags of various items within an e-commerce application. There is no front-end UI, so the user must use Insomnia or something similar to test the API endpoints and the efficacy of the various PUT, POST, GET, and DELETE methods.
